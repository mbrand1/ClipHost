0.4   2012-05-06 (meb): Made popup.html close after a time. Put javascript into popup.js.

0.3   2011-07-17 (meb): Put displayed hostname into an input window to allow selection by clicking.  This allows the hostname
                        to be copied into Unix's "selected" clipboard (copying into the regular clipboard still happens 
			automatically).

0.2 - 2011-07-04 (meb): look at tab.url instead of window.location.href which isn't reliable

0.1 - 2011-07-03 (meb):  Got it working.  Added a decent icon.
