This Chrome extension extracts the raw hostname from the current tab's address bar.  It strips off the leading http://
and any trailing path information.  Use this extension when you want to copy-paste just the host into a terminal window
to do a hostname lookup or traceroute.    Normally if you select just the hostname inside Chrome's location bar, it tacks
on the leading http://.  This extension counteracts that.

2011-07-16 (meb): Now works with Unix's Selected Clipboard!  Just click the displayed hostname for middle-button pasting goodness!

2012-05-10 (meb): Displayed hostname will disappear after a time (controllable from options).
