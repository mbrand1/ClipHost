ClipHost - Chrome Extension
============================

This Chrome extension extracts the raw hostname from the current tab's address bar. It strips off the leading http://
and any trailing path information. Use this extension when you want to copy-paste just the host into a terminal window
to do a hostname lookup or traceroute. Normally if you select just the hostname inside Chrome's location bar, it tacks
on the leading http://. This extension counteracts that.

Features:
- Automatically copies hostname to clipboard
- Works with Unix's Selected Clipboard (click the displayed hostname for middle-button pasting)
- Auto-close popup after configurable time (controllable from options)

Version 1.0 (2025-11-15):
Updated to Manifest V3 for compatibility with modern Chrome browsers. This version uses the latest Chrome extension
APIs including chrome.storage, modern Clipboard API, and follows current security best practices.

Requirements:
- Chrome browser with Manifest V3 support (Chrome 88+)

Installation:
1. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this directory
